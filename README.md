# ProjectPDFs

This repository contains final project PDFs for various courses I took at CU Boulder and UW Seattle. In particular:

## CU Boulder:
  
### APPM 3310: Matrix Methods  
- We followed in the footsteps of the winners of the Netflix Prize competition and implemented a recommender system which performed better than Netflix's benchmark.  
  
### APPM 4350: Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems  
- Our group analyzed the structure of soliton waves, both theoretically and from experimental data, and compared the two. We found that the experimental results may not have been solitons.  
  
### APPM 4360: Complex Variables and Applications
- We studied the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation and the connection to elliptic functions.  

### APPM 4450: Undergraduate Numerical Analysis II
- As a team of two, we derived the Gamma function and proved various interesting properties that it has.  

### APPM 4600: Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing
- As a team of three, we derived Ridge Regression and the Tikhonov Estimator. We then empirically studied Least Squared, Ridge Regression, Tikhonov Regression, LASSO, and Elastic-Net.

### Undergraduation Senior Thesis
- Under Dr. Stephen Becker, I learned about the theory of first-order Bayesian Optimization (FOBO) and contributed to the open-source Bayesian Optimization library BoTorch so that FOBO is available to all researchers.

## UW Seattle:

### AMATH 515 A: Optimization: Fundamentals and Applications
- We study the role of different stochastic gradient descent algorithms and stepsizing schemes on both CNNs and Transformers.

### CSE 599/542: Reinforcement Learning
- I attempt to reproduce results in the literature around neural network plasticity and capacity loss by training a CNN and MLP on a changing objective. I obtain a result opposite to what the previous literature has observed.
