# ProjectPDFs

This repository contains final project PDFs for various courses I took at CU Boulder. In particular:
  
### APPM 3310: Matrix Methods  
- We followed in the footsteps of the winners of the Netflix Prize competition and implemented a recommender system which performed better than Netflix's benchmark.  
  
### APPM 4350: Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems  
- Our group analyzed the structure of soliton waves, both theoretically and from experimental data, and compared the two. We found that the experimental results may not have been solitons.  
  
### APPM 4360: Complex Variables and Applications
- We studied the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation and the connection to elliptic functions.  

### APPM 4450: Undergraduate Numerical Analysis II
- As a team of two, we derived the Gamma function and proved various interesting properties that it has.
